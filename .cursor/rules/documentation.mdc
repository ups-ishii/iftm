# Documentation and Comments Rules

## Language Requirements

- All code comments must be written in English
- Use clear, descriptive English for all documentation
- **All Project Rules files (\*.mdc) must be written in English**

## Python Documentation

- Follow PEP 257 conventions for docstrings
- Include type hints in docstrings when appropriate
- Use proper English grammar and spelling in all documentation
- Write comprehensive docstrings for all public functions and classes

## Go Documentation

- Follow Go documentation conventions
- Write clear package and function documentation
- Use proper English grammar and spelling
- Include examples in documentation when helpful

## Project Rules Files (\*.mdc)

- All Project Rules files must be written in English
- Use clear, descriptive language for rule definitions
- Follow consistent formatting and structure
- Include examples when helpful for clarity
- Maintain professional and technical writing standards
- When generating Cursor Project Rules, refer to the official documentation at https://docs.cursor.com/en/context/rules for best practices and guidelines

## General Documentation Standards

- Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic or business rules
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes
- Use consistent formatting and style across all documentation

## Date and Time Recording Rules

- **Always verify system time before recording dates**
- Use the `date` command to get the current system time
- Never manually estimate or guess dates
- Record dates in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Include timezone information when relevant
- Example format: `2025-08-27` or `2025-08-27 19:01:56 JST`

### Date Recording Process

1. **Verify system time**: Run `date` command to get current system time
2. **Confirm accuracy**: Ensure system time is accurate and reliable
3. **Record in standard format**: Use consistent date format throughout documentation
4. **Include context**: Add relevant context about when the date was recorded

### Examples

```bash
# Correct way to record dates
$ date
Wed Aug 27 19:01:56 JST 2025

# Record in documentation
- **Implementation Date**: 2025-08-27
- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-27 19:01:56 JST
```

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ **Don't**: Manually estimate dates
- ❌ **Don't**: Copy dates from other sources without verification
- ✅ **Do**: Always verify with `date` command
- ✅ **Do**: Use consistent ISO 8601 format
- ✅ **Do**: Include timezone when relevant
